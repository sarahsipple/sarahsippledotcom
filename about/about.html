            <p>Welcome! I am a born & raised Michigander who loves to be near a lake whenever I can be.</p>
            <p>I drink coffee constantly, and haven't met a dog I don't love.</p>
            <p>I have worked in customer service for over a decade, so I know all about putting the customer first. User-focused design and development is what makes products great - and super successful. Even though my job title isn't "customer service" anymore, my job will always be to serve the customer.</p>
            <p>Check out <a href="../portfolio/portfolio.html">my portfolio here</a>, or <a href="../contact/contact.html">contact me</a> to chat!</p>
